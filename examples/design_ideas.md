# Logo Design Ideas

This document contains ideas and inspiration for creating logos with the Logo Designer application.

## Single Letter Logos

Many successful brands use single letter logos. Some examples to try:

1. **Netflix "N"** - A simple, bold red "N" on a black background.
2. **Google "G"** - A colorful "G" using the Google color palette (blue, red, yellow, green).
3. **Meta "M"** - A gradient blue "M".
4. **Uber "U"** - A simple black "U" on a white background.

## Multi-Letter Logos

Creating a logo with multiple letters:

1. **IBM** - Blue letters with horizontal striping effect.
2. **HBO** - A simple, bold design.
3. **CNN** - Bold letters with a thin line separating them.
4. **NASA** - Red curved lettering ("the worm").

## 3D Effects

The application supports 3D effects that can make your logo pop:

1. Try a single letter with a deep 3D effect and a contrasting shadow.
2. Create a layered 3D effect with multiple copies of the same letter.
3. Combine 3D with rotation for an interesting perspective.

## Color Ideas

Effective color combinations for logos:

1. **Black & Yellow** - High contrast and visibility (e.g., National Geographic)
2. **Blue & White** - Professional and trustworthy (e.g., Facebook, Ford)
3. **Red & White** - Bold and attention-grabbing (e.g., YouTube, Coca-Cola)
4. **Gradients** - Modern and dynamic (e.g., Instagram's purple-to-orange gradient)

## Styling Techniques

Special effects that can enhance your logo:

1. **Shadow effects** - Add depth with a subtle drop shadow.
2. **Outlines** - Create contrast with a bright outline on darker text.
3. **Rotated text** - Angle the text slightly for a dynamic feel.
4. **Layered elements** - Combine multiple text elements with different effects.

## Export Tips

For the best quality exports:

1. Use PNG format with transparency for web use.
2. Higher DPI (300+) for print materials.
3. Consider creating multiple sizes for different applications.
4. For app icons, export as ICO or multiple PNG sizes.
